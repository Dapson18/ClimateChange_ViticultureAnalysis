# My R Project

## Description
This project focuses on the range shift of *Vitis vinifera* under future climate change scenarios in North America. It utilizes R for data analysis, visualization, and modeling to predict potential distribution changes for this economically significant species.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handles raw environmental and species data.
- **Modeling:** Uses predictive modeling techniques to assess potential range shifts.
- **Visualization:** Includes plots and maps showing current and predicted distributions.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- RStudio (optional, but recommended)
- Required R packages:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `ggplot2`
  - `dplyr`
  - `sf`
  - `raster`
  - `sp`

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
=======
   git clone https://github.com/Dapson18/ClimateChange_ViticultureAnalysis
.git
>>>>>>> 244819392089cb41e2702f81c7963640809b5500
   ```
2. Open the project in RStudio.
3. Install the required packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "sf", "raster", "sp"))
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the project files in RStudio.
2. Follow the scripts in the `scripts/` folder for:
   - Data preparation (`data_preprocessing.R`)
   - Model training (`model_training.R`)
   - Visualization (`visualization.R`)
3. Generated outputs, such as plots and maps, will be saved in the `outputs/` folder.
